title: Today is the last day of my 20's. Here's what I've learned.
---

I turn 30 years old tomorrow. On the last day of my 20's, I'm at the point where I can look back and definitively say what I've learned in the last 10 years. When I turned 20, I was a typical college kid who had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. I still don't think I've fully answered that question, but I have gleaned some knowledge in the process.

### Be nice

I've never considered myself a mean guy or anything, but I'm constantly impressed at how a little bit of cordiality can improve someone's situation. The girl I'm marrying might be the best person I know at being consistently nice to strangers, and it makes going through life that much less stressful.

### Work > Talk

Anybody can talk a good game, but it's those who actually buckle down and put the work in that end up winning it. There's your sports metaphor. I've never finished a tough project and regretted it.

### Surround yourself with people who make you happy

I've been incredibly lucky that I have tons of people in my life that I get to hang out with that keep me afloat, but life's too short to waste with toxic people. If certain people make you miserable, they don't deserve your time.

### Keep it simple, stupid

Trying to do everything at once results in everything getting half done and nothing getting fully done. Get rid of things that don't add value to your life, and you'll be that much better for it.

### You don't need most things

Stop accumulating stuff and then keeping it just to keep it. I'm always surprised how little I use compared to how much stuff I've owned. I'm still doing my best to downsize and get rid of stuff I don't need, and will continue to.

### The world is large

If I've learned anything, this is the most important thing. People are so quick to focus on their own insular bubble, when if you look around, there's so much world out there. There are so many people out there with so many other situations and problems, and all of it is worth exploring and listening to. Even if you can't travel (I definitely haven't had money to), reading about other places and cultures has shaped so much about how I think about the world now.

### Get a dog

Dogs are the best.


I'd like to thank all of you who made the last 10 years so great, and can't wait to see what the next decade has in store.
