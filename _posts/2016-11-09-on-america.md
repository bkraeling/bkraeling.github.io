title: Three stages of dealing with an American tragedy
---

I'm not normally one to comment publicly on political issues, but I think that what happened yesterday is too important not to comment on. I wrote three sets of thoughts, one as results were coming in, one this morning, and one after having the day to reflect. I found my thoughts in three distinct moods, and writing about it made me feel better.

### 12:00 AM EST, 11/9/16

It’s midnight in the Eastern Time Zone. Election coverage is wrapping up, and it looks like the American people decided that Donald Trump should be the next leader of the free world.

Looking objectively, I can point to reasons why the country was going to lean this way. People in rural areas are tired of not having a voice, the Democratic establishment continuously looks down on those who don’t agree with them instead of striving for understanding and compromise, and that same establishment used a flawed primary system to bring forth a candidate that despite her obvious accomplishments, had her flaws and has been generally disliked in the public spotlight for the last 20 or so years.

Then again, I’ve seen plenty of other things to make me think that America is better than Donald Trump. Trump, at his core, is a misogynistic, boorish piece of shit, who, to use a baseball analogy, wasn’t even born on third base and thought he hit a homer, he was born on the bottom of the pile after the post-walkoff celebration. You know this, I know this, America knows this. To deny this is to deny that 3+3 is 6 because “we might not have all the facts, we’ll look into it at the time”.

And I had high hopes for America. I watched eagerly as I saw voter after voter, poll after poll, and people I knew who had the compassion to try and be on the right side of history. I still believe those people will be proven to be, but those people didn’t speak for America tonight.

America used its collective voice, and decided that it isn’t better than Donald Trump. It decided that if you’re not a straight white male, that it should be harder for you to live in this country. Honestly, I am, so this result won’t affect me personally as much as it will others. But I look at my black friends, my gay friends, my Latino friends, my Muslim friends, my Jewish friends, and even my female friends. I look at how this election affects them, not only relating to policies that will likely strip them of rights, but validating the rhetoric against them that has now become commonplace. I look at my friends and family members who supported this and can’t bring myself to respect them. This isn’t “politics as usual”, this is real people’s lives that will be made worse because a white populace wanted to “shake up” the establishment. I see so many people who ignored this election or said that it didn’t matter who got elected, but that Gary Johnson “protest vote” just cost someone health insurance. That vote took away a woman’s right to necessary medical care, that vote validated the KKK’s message, that vote said it was okay to make fun of the disabled.

I’m not sure where to go from here. It’s easy to say that it’s time to buckle down and help fix things, but is the America that voted today worth fixing? If that’s what America stands for, what’s to separate it from other places with extreme human rights violations? How is it better? Land of the free? Sure, if you’re a straight white male. Home of the brave? Not if those “brave” won’t show up to the polls to stop a piece of garbage like Trump be the president.

I’d like to stay on the side of hope. I’d like to work to make a difference, to turn America away of the doldrums that it’s likely heading toward. But we as a nation need to figure out what kind of America we’re trying to save.

### 7:00 AM EST, 11/9/16

On the morning after, I’m still filled with that same dread about what’s about to happen to this country. But more hope, and more optimism.

I’ll likely never agree with Donald Trump about any of his issues, but one thing he has made clear is that somewhere along the way, America stopped calling out bullshit. Whether that’s because someone like Jon Stewart, who made a 15-year TV career out of doing it is gone, or that the voices we have calling out bullshit aren’t loud enough yet, somewhere along the way, millions of Americans decided to start letting little shit slide. One tenet that Trump based his campaign on is that it’s time to start calling out bullshit, even if the vast majority of bullshit he’s trying to call out is complete garbage.

Yes, it’s time for peace and love and all of the Dr. King quotes I’m seeing today were right about the effect embracing those things will have on the hate that perpetuates itself through this country. But it’s clearly time to be more vocal about bullshit, and calling it out when we see it as a nation.

As for what you and I can do? It’s time to show the world that we’re better than this. It’s time to show the world that this isn’t a nation of backward-ass hillbilly idiots. I’m not #WithHer at this point, or with anybody, I’m with progress and advancing this nation and the world for everybody living here.

If the rest of the world needs to grab you by the collar and smack you upside the head like a mom whose kid is acting up in the middle of Wal-Mart, so be it. I hope it happens eventually. If America needs to be dragged into the 21st century kicking and screaming, that’s what the world needs to do now.

It’s up to everyone to make that change now. It’s time to call out the bullshit.

If you voted against progress today, fuck you. I hope everything he promised happens so you can see the complete fucking mess you just contributed to. I hope your kids hear his rhetoric so you can see what kind of monsters you’ll be getting to deal with. I hope you have to custom order your kid’s white hood because they haven’t made them in less than an XL in 100 years.

I want this to happen because I want you to see what everybody else sees when they look at this country. I want you to realize that a society can’t function like this, with hate flowing from the top down, that we’re no better than an authoritarian or a dictator, the ones that we’ve fought wars to try and dispense.

If you contributed to this version of America, you deserve exactly what’s coming to you. Everybody else, it’s time to band together, call out the bullshit, and get this world rolling back in the right direction again.

### 6:00 PM EST, 11/9/16

After having a day to accept the fate of our nation, I’m left with a few takeaways:

* To those of you talking about how things won’t change because of this election: please look at things from the other side’s perspective and figure out why people are as sad and upset as they are about how this election went.
* To those of you expressing disappointment and calling the other side dumb for voting the way they did: this is why this happened. Stupidity and ignorance are not the same, and those in the middle of the country are tired of know-it-alls calling them stupid. Recognize this, because these are now people you have to convince not to wreck progress.
* To those of you who supported Trump and continue to: I still don’t respect you, but I’m glad I don’t have to deal with the inner demons that you’re about to have to deal with. You may not be a racist, but know that you supported one and have to live with that reality. You can’t deny it and pretend it doesn’t exist, and you should have to answer for your vote.
* To my friends who are parents who voted for Trump: I’m blown away that you’re okay that this man going to be a role model for your child, and I urge you to teach your children to be good people first and foremost.
* If there’s a silver lining here, it’s that this nation deciding that racism and homophobia and misogyny are okay will probably make most mainstream social networking as we know it. That’s a good thing to me. Any move that releases us to focus on what matters is a good thing. To me, that means doing meaningful work, making a positive difference in the world, and enjoying the great people in my life. Everything else is noise.
