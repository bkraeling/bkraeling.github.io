title: New Year's Resolutions?
---

I've always been one to plan meticulously for the New Year. I've read so many blog posts about people's resolutions, and have always been the type of person to look forward to the new year with optimism with a concrete plan to better myself in the year that comes. I’ve had varying degrees of success there. Every once in a while, a resolution sticks (I still don’t drink soda), but for the most part, I put a valiant effort together for a few weeks and fall right back into old habits.

This year, I haven’t even thought about it. I have a long list of things I’d like to learn and get better at, and projects that I’ve wanted to sit down and explore, but I’ve realized this past year that I don’t need an arbitrary holiday to get that done. That’s something I can work on every single day.

My only “New Year’s Resolution” for 2017 is to keep the important things in mind. For me, that takes shape in a lot of different places, and I’m constantly trying to build habits to better keep things in perspective and keep my mindset in the right place.
