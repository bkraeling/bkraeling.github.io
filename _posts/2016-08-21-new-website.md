Hi.

I decided to start a website. This'll be a personal repository of the projects I've worked on (and will be working on in the future), as well as a blog for random thoughts and musings going forward. I've been writing on the web for years now, but I've never really had a one-stop shop for those interested in my work, instead opting for having a bunch of stuff spread out over a ton of different places. This'll be a lot more centrally located, and I'll be able to update things more frequently here.

Stay tuned.
