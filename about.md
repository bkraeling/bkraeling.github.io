title: About Brandon
---


I'm a web developer based in the Cincinnati area. I'm committed to building things and am passionate about spreading knowledge and making the world a better place for everybody.

I've developed in a platitude of web and native application interfaces, but I have the most recent experience using Ruby on Rails on the web side. Check out my resume to see a more extensive breakdown of what I've done.

I'm also an accomplished writer. I've written for the SB Nation network (specifically [Red Reporter](http://www.redreporter.com)) since 2008, and have been linked by Deadspin, as well as numerous other web publications. I've been consulted as a Cincinnati Reds expert on multiple radio and podcast appearances, and have contributed to Reds annual publications as well.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching soccer at Nippert Stadium, rooting on my alma mater (Xavier) on the basketball court, bar trivia (3x Cincinnati champ), and spending time outside with my fianc√©e and our dog.  

Questions or suggestions? Shoot me an email (bkraeling@gmail.com) [or tweet](http://twitter.com/themusketeer) and I'd be happy to chat.
